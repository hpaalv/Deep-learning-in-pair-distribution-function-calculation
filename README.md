# Deep-learning-in-pair-distribution-function-calculation

Application of Convolutional Neural Networks in Pair Distribution Function Calculation to Analyze Data (Diffraction Patterns) from Transmission Electron Microscopy.

This project was developed by Paulo Henrique and SÃ©rgio Servilha during their undergraduate studies at the Ilum School of Science, a college connected to the Brazilian National Center of Research in Materials and Energy, in the course of Introdution to Research II, where they follow a research field in the Center and develop a project of their choice.
